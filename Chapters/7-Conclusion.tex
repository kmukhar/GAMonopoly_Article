\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}

This study showed that evolutionary computing can be used to evolve players for
the non-deterministic game Monopoly. These players can perform well in the
simulated environment in which they evolved. These players also appear to use
strategies similar to those that have been developed heuristically by real-world
players.

Based on the results and other questions encountered during this study,
additional research can be conducted in the following areas:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The players in this simulation do not make property trades. The
  literature on Monopoly claims that this is a vital part of the game. This
  functionality should be implemented and tested to see if the evolved players
  do better.
  \item The fitness distribution for the SGA player diverged from the mean over
  many generations rather than converged as was expected. Further investigation
  is needed to determine whether this is an anomaly or if there is some logical
  reason for this.
  \item Further play with multiple evolved players (both low and high simulation
  fitness) against real or AI players should be conducted to evaluate the real
  (rather than simulated fitness) of the population.
\end{enumerate}
