\chapter{TGA Population Statistics}
\label{appendix:tgastats}

This appendix contains descriptive statistics for the fitness scores for a
subset of the TGA populations. For each population, the fitness min,
max, average, variance, and standard deviation are given.

Each population is identified using the same short name used in the text. For
example: \\ 

TGA-0128-025-NM \\ 

The first three characters are the chromosome type, TGA in the example. \\

The first number is the population size, 128 in the example. \\

The second number is the number of matches per generation, 25 in the example. \\

The final two characters are an identifier for the fitness evaluator, NM
(number of monopolies) in the example.
